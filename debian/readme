Mariadb install doesnt seem to install right, so work around is to run this first before the script

When the install happens and frezzes, reboot the server and then run the install script

apt-get --reinstall install -y bsdutils
apt install -y dialog
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y mariadb-server

----
reboot when it freezes
-----

After reboot run:
dpkg --configure -a
