# Small-VPS-LEMP-Install
LEMP Install settings on a low ram VPS tested on 128mb

CentOS 7 ONLY
IPv6

bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sumiza/Small-VPS-LEMP-Install/master/install.sh)



this was just written for a 128mb server from https://hosting.gullo.me/ but would think should work on any small server.

Do not use this if you are installing this on a normal sized server or any other OS, if youre looking for command line installer that do it all a good one is https://centminmod.com/
