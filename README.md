# Small-VPS-LEMP-Install
LEMP Installer for ipv6

CentOS 7 ONLY
IPv6

comes in two versions, default settings for any standard server and low ram settings for servers with low ram.

bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sumiza/Small-VPS-LEMP-Install/master/install.sh)

This was just written for a 128mb server from https://hosting.gullo.me/ but would think should work on any small ipv6 server.

It has no safeguards built in, if you type something wrong it will just break, dont have to try.

Do not use this if you are installing this on any other OS, if youre looking for command line installer that does it all a good one is https://centminmod.com/
